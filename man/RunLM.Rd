\title{Function that runs linear models and returns interaction p-values.}
\usage{
RunLM(incommon, outcome = "metabolite", type = NULL, covar = NULL,
  continuous = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{incommon}{MultiDataSet object (output of ReadData()) with gene}

\item{outcome}{'metabolite' or 'gene' must be set as outcome/independent variable
(default is 'metabolite')}

\item{type}{vector of sample type (by default, it will be used in the interaction term).
Only 2 categories are currently supported.}

\item{covar}{vector of additional vectors to consider}

\item{continuous}{boolean to indicate whether the data is continuous or discrete}
